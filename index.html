				Hello there!<br>
                I am primarily an engineer but I truly believe that a man should strive to be a polymath. An autodidact polymath, a true renaissance man. 
                <br>
				I work on logic and mathematical/programming strategies to address abstract financial problems.
				My efficiency keeps up even while working under duress since at GreenShaw, I had to make key financial 
				decisions and had to think on my feet and this taught me diligence under pressure.
				Because I didn't have many mentors, I grew to be an expert at independent research.
				Working on potentially overwhelming difficulties without supervision helped me master googling.
				Long periods of time spent working with computer code and data put my concentration and attention span to the test.
